# pyhon_pizza project

This code is a simple pizza ordering program written in Python. It starts with a greeting and a prompt asking the user to choose a type of pizza. Then, it asks the user for the pizza size and calculates the price based on the selected options. The result is stored in the variable 'result'. The program uses a while loop to keep the ordering process running until a condition is met.

The user is prompted with various questions like crust thickness, price, and whether to add the pizza to the cart. Then, the price is added to the 'result' variable based on the user's choices.

The project was made by Andrey Kreynin and Ivan Kovin:)
